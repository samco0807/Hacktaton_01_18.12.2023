Samuel: Antisemitism awareness quizz
Th project is simple but it is working and you could review many concepts about 
Python functions, JSON and Database. 
I am happy you did present it and very proud of your effort and hard work in doing your best!
My advice for you is to keep working in this project. The next step can be implementing OOP:
Creating classes and methods to: 1. connection and saving data in the db. 2: A QUIZZ class with methods to display a menu: start quizz or see leaderboard.
